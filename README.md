# My DotFiles for my Linux

My configuration is based on some dotfiles and themes running on Debian 13. Some files are modified.

Here is the original dotfiles:

- Hyprland installations and dotfiles : [Debian-Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland)
- Grub theme [Linux Generic](https://github.com/Coopydood/HyperFluent-GRUB-Theme)
- Plymouth theme [Plymouth]()
